; To use it, first save it as "config.txt", then edit it for your own

; Because ".txt" files are not tracked by github in this repository,
; each machine can have its own config.txt file that will not be
; overwritten by git updates.

; Target record frame rate
RECORD_FRAME_RATE = 10

; Codec type. Usually either h264 or mp4v.
; h264 is very efficient at compression (1-2MB/min) but somewhat CPU intensive.
; mp4v is less efficient (~5-10MB/min) but uses less CPU, allowing higher frame rates.
FOURCC = h264
; FOURCC = mp4v

; Resolution to request from camera. Not all resolutions are supported by all cameras,
; and most cameras internally limit frame rate as resolution increases. Some examples:
;
; Many cheap-o webcams support the following:
;
;  4:3 aspect ratio options:
;     320x240 at 30fps
;     640x480 at 30fps
;     800x600 at 15fps
;     1024x768 at 10fps
;     1280x960 at 7.5fps
;     1440x1080 at 5fps
;
;  16:9 aspect ratio options:
;
;     1280x720 at 10fps in YUY mode, 20fps in MJPG mode
;     1920x1080 at 5fps in YUY mode, 10fps in MJPG mode
;
; Logitech c920e webcam supports the following:

;     (4:3 aspect ratio):  320x240, 640x480, 1280x960
;     (16:9 aspect ratio): 640x360, 1024x576, 1280x720, 1920x1080
;     1024x720   (64:45 aspect ratio that is close to 4:3 but not quite)
;     1280x960   (4:3 aspect ratio that actually captures at 16:9, which basically takes a widescreen and squashes it into a 4:3 screen)
; Strangely, logitech c920e does not support 1024x768 and 1280x1024 formats.
