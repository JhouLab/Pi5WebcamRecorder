; THIS IS A SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE
;
; To use it, first save it as "config.txt", then edit it for your own
; needs.
;
; Because ".txt" files are not tracked by github in this repository,
; each machine can have its own config.txt file that will not be
; overwritten by updates.
;
; If any configuration option is missing, reasonable defaults will be
; chosen. So having a "config.txt" file is optional unless you want to
; override the defaults.

[options]

; Program runs an internal loop that requests one camera frame per loop.
; This variable sets how often this loop runs, in frames per second.
; Most webcams max out around 29-30fps, so loop won't run faster than that.
; Because CPU needs time to compress frames, the practical limit is usually lower,
; e.g. 15-20fps when recording 4 cameras on Pi5 with h264.
FRAME_RATE_PER_SECOND = 10

; Main choices for the FOURCC code are h264 and mp4v.
; h264 is very efficient at compression (1-2MB/min) but somewhat CPU intensive.
; mp4v is less efficient (~5-10MB/min) but uses less CPU, allowing higher frame rates.
; mjpg 
FOURCC = h264
; FOURCC = mp4v

; Specify how many grouped pulses to start/end session.
NUM_TTL_PULSES_TO_START_SESSION = 2
NUM_TTL_PULSES_TO_STOP_SESSION = 3

; Resolution to request from camera. Not all resolutions are supported by all cameras,
; and most cameras internally limit frame rate as resolution increases. Some examples:
;
; Many cheap-o webcams support the following:
;
;  4:3 aspect ratio options:
;     320x240 at 30fps
;     640x480 at 30fps
;     800x600 at 15fps
;     1024x768 at 10fps
;     1280x960 at 7.5fps
;     1440x1080 at 5fps
;
;  16:9 aspect ratio options:
;
;     1280x720 at 10fps in YUY mode, 20fps in MJPG mode
;     1920x1080 at 5fps in YUY mode, 10fps in MJPG mode
;
; Logitech c920e webcam supports the following:

;     (4:3 aspect ratio):  320x240, 640x480, 1280x960
;     (16:9 aspect ratio): 640x360, 1024x576, 1280x720, 1920x1080
;     1024x720   (64:45 aspect ratio that is close to 4:3 but not quite)
;     1280x960   (4:3 aspect ratio that actually captures at 16:9, which basically takes a widescreen and squashes it into a 4:3 screen)
; Strangely, logitech c920e does not support 1024x768 and 1280x1024 formats.
